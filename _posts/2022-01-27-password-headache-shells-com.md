When you start an instance you have no sudo password set
You have to set it  in this way [Changing your Operating System Password and Admin Password on your Shellâ„¢ | Shells official site](https://www.shells.com/l/en-US/tutorial/Changing-your-Operating-System-Password-and-Admin-Password-on-your-Shell%E2%84%A2)
